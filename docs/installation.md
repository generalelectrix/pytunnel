# Server installation (Python 2)

0. In a fresh virtual environment: $ python setup.py install
0. run.sh

# Controllers

Install controller_templates/pytunnel.touchosc on a tablet of your choice running TouchOSC.  Natively scaled for iPad.  Connect to a network midi session on the server via Audio Midi Setup/Core MIDI (you may need to turn ipv6 off: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7695767 )

Note that you may need to rename your network session until I fix [Issue 20](https://github.com/generalelectrix/pytunnel/issues/20).

APC40 and APC20 should work out of the box.
